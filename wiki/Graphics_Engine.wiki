= Introduction =

Perhaps the most challenging part. The 2D Graphics Engine needs to simulate all the commands(from the Python or Lua interpreter) for a given C++ robot.

= Engine =

All the robots, sensors and everything else are  [http://doc.trolltech.com/qgraphicsitem.html QGraphicsItem] objects, so it's easy to handle collisions and graphic paintings. All these items belongs to a [http://doc.trolltech.com/qgraphicsscene.html QGraphicsScene], and this will make visible to the user by showing them(items) in a [http://doc.trolltech.com/qgraphicsview.html QGraphicsView] render engine.

= Current status =

The Robot and Sensor interface are advanced in big steps. There is also a need to build a Map interface, which will be the map for the interaction of a scene.
The biggest challenge here is to make a !RobotInterface::advance()`*` visible and editable from the interpreter (Python or Lua scripts).

`*` !RobotInterface inherits this method from QGraphicsItem
