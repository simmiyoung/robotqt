#summary Robot Core is the bases of  plugin and  extensions support
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Robot Core basically consists on a plugin system. There is *!RobotInterface*, *!SensorInterface* and *!MapInterface* interfaces that inherits a _!BasePlugin_ class.

= Current Status =

*!RobotInterface*, *!SensorInterface* and _!BasePlugin_ are implemented but there is room for changes, fixes and features.

= Implementation =

*!MapInterface* needs to have these characteristic:
  * Inherits QGraphicsItem and _!BasePlugin_, in order
  * Proprieties:
    * QRectF with x, y, width and height values
    * ...
  * Implement `void QGraphicsItem::paint (QPainter * painter, const QStyleOptionGraphicsItem * option, QWidget * widget = 0)` method to draw all map items
  * Implement `QPainterPath QGraphicsItem::shape()` method to return a more accurate shape for fine-grained collision detection.
