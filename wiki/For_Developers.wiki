= Introduction =

!RobotQt it's a *really* big project. That's why _we need you_!
We mainly use C++ with Qt framework for its development. But there is also Lua and Python implementations.
So, if you want to learn and contribute for a promiser project, read more!


= How To Contribute? =

It's easy!
Just send us an e-mail to felipe.tonello@gmail.com and tell your interests. Than we will add you as a project member.

= Basics of the Projects =

!RobotQt internals is basically three distinct parts.
  # Graphics_Engine - *strong C++ knowledge*
  # Robot_Core (that make possible to create robots extensions and sensors and motors as well) - *light C++ knowledge*
  # Python_And_Lua_Interpreter - *medium interpreter knowledge and Lua and Python implementations*

= Building From the Source =
There are few steps:
  # [http://code.google.com/p/robotqt/source/checkout checkout the code]
  # From its main directory: `qmake RobotQt.pro`
  # Compile it: `make` (or `make install` to install the headers for plugin development)
  # Run !RobotQt binary!

You should have [http://qt.nokia.com Qt 4.3], or newer, development packages.

= Commiting =

You can use your preferable user client for Subversion, or always use the command line version:
  # `svn stat` to make sure that all your modifications and implementations are correct.
  # `svn ci -m "your comments"` to commit.
